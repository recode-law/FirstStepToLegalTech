# Session 2: The Python Roadmap

## Security 
### SSH Keys
How to create your own SSH Key? 
1. Generate an SSH-Key and add to the ssh-agent [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
2. Adding a new SSH-Key to Github [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

## Why do we learn Python in this course ?
There are three reasons:
1. Easy readible 
2. Script-language
3. Large community 

Python is currently the most popular programming language [Popular Languages 2022](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022).


## Roadmap
There are learning pathways for different careers in development. 
Similarly to lawyers developers focus and specialize in their careers on different topics. 
Some want to create logical processes in the backend of applications, 
some want to design the interaction elements in the frontend and other want to administer networks for organisations ... 
and many others. The variety is nearly endless and one can combine many options like programming languages for a certain pathway. 

You can find many roadmaps at: [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)


An easy pathway to start with is the Python Roadmap, it helps to understand programming and easy concepts. 

## Python Roadmap
Today we start with the Python Roadmap, because it is an easy start to programming

Data handling
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - for working with lists and array in a simple way
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - for working with tables 

Data visualization:
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) - for visualizing simple graphs/plots
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) - for pre-configured graphs/plots
